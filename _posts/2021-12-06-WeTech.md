### About the Program

The [Women Enhancing Technology (WeTechÂ®) Mentorship Program Award](https://www.iie.org/en/Programs/WeTech/STEM-Scholarships-for-Women/Goldman-Sachs-Scholarship) is presented by Goldman Sachs & IIE (Institute of International Education). It is designed to support a series of innovative activities and to provide training, build networks and offer professional opportunities.

The selection process was based on requirements such as demonstrated leadership potential in ICT, and academic achievement, amongst others.

I was selected as part of the WeTech Program for 2019-20, under the mentorship of Mr. Sahit Mosali, Analyst, Goldman Sachs.

### My Experience

The program took place over a period of six months, starting from April 2019 - October 2019.

Over the course of the program, there were specific activities designed for the following -
* Assessing strengths
* Career Planning
* Writing skills
* Interview skills
* Enhancing Technical Skills
* Networking

Through the program, I was able to take a Gallup Assessment on finding my strenghts. The result remains very interesting to me till date :)

**Strengths** - Strategic, Activator, Restorative, Intellection, Significance.
