##### Our Contributions

In this work, we propose a smart circular Early Warning System for epidemics.

I was involved in designing of the system and the development of a Mobile Application for notification for area-wide alerts using Android Studio.

You may not believe it but we worked on this subject pre-COVID-19. Later on, we incorporated data from the COVID-19 pandemic to validate our system.

#### Presentations

##### S3 INAC 2019

We were selected to present our work at the Students' Special Symposium Indian Society Of Systems For Science And Engineering (ISSE) National Conference-4 (INAC) at Space Application Centre,  Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Ahmedabad. The Conference was hosted by Space Application Centre, Ahmedabad and Organised by ISSE Ahmedabad Chapter.

The theme of the conference was "Systems for Transforming India : Challenges & Opportunities"

We completed our presentation on the 27th of September, 2019!
