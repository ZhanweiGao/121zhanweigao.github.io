### About - NASA Space Apps Challenge

The NASA Space Apps Challenge is a platform to showcase inventive solutions to real-world challenges using actual data from space.

In 2020, the theme was "Take Action," a reminder that we can be a part of the solution to our world's challenges. The following categories were presented - Observe, Inform, Sustain, Create, Confront, and Connect.

My team and I worked on the Confront Challenge -

> Your challenge is to create a tool, app, or resource that helps close a gap that causes people to experience inequality. This combination of humanity and technology should eliminate or lessen a systemic issue and educate the user so they can grow.

We worked on creating a tool which harnesses the power of humanity and technology to lessen a systemic issue and educate users so they can grow.

We built a front-end application using Django and NASA WorldWind, with a relational database in the back-end. We perform Natural Language Processing using Python for Keyword Extraction, and Text Similarity for Web Scraping and RSS feeds results along with Twitter Analysis.

The current events, which triggered a movement on social media and led to positive change, acted as our motivation to use this platform to address an important issue. Aptly, we've named our solution 'Ummeed', which means hope.

Our team received the Local Choice Winner (Pune Region) Award.
